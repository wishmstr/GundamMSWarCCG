3 quick things of note on this plugin:

- It was created using the community-made v2.1 of the rules.  As such, the only Mission cards included were the 4 from the Set 1 starters.  They are not used with the new rules.

- There are no promos in the database as actual scans of them are scarce.  I'd be willing to add them, should good scans become available.

- Some of the card names have a -1, -2, etc.  This was necessary for the database as with so many cards with so many variants (9 different cards named Leo!) caused problems with deck building.  This numbering is only for Lackey's purpose.
